# Hi, how's it going?

My name is Adriel, and I have a degree in Information Systems from UFRN.

I work with web development and I'm always trying to learn something new.

When I have free time, I study technologies that are relevant in the market  
and align with my career goals.

You can find some of my personal projects here or on my  
[portfolio](https://adrielfsantos.vercel.app/). Feel free to  
browse through the repositories.
